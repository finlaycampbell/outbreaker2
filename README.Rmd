*outbreaker2: a framework for reconstructing disease outbreaks*
---------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the project page of *outbreaker2*, a Bayesian framework
 for integrating epidemiological and genetic data to reconstruct transmission
 trees of densely sampled outbreaks. It re-implements, generalises and replaces
 the model of [*outbreaker*](https://github.com/thibautjombart/outbreaker), and uses
 a modular approach which enables fine customisation of priors, likelihoods
 and parameter movements (see [customisation
 vignette](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaker2/articles/customisation.html)).

### NOTE: Correction to genetic likelihood

The genetic likelihood of the [original *outbreaker* paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003457) was found to contain a minor mistake in accounting for unobserved generations of infection. As of June 7th 2019, *outbreaker2* will use the correct genetic likelihood published [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006930).

The original genetic likelihood was:

$$\mu^{d(s_i,s_{\alpha_i})}(1 - \mu)^{(\kappa_i\times l(s_i, s_{\alpha_i})) - d(s_i,s_{\alpha_i})}$$

The corrected genetic likelihood is:

$$(\kappa_i \mu)^{d(s_i,s_{\alpha_i})}(1 - \mu)^{(\kappa_i\times l(s_i, s_{\alpha_i})) - d(s_i,s_{\alpha_i})}$$

Installation
-------------

To install the stable version from CRAN:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("outbreaker2")
```

To install the development version from github (requires Rtools on windows and
GSL headers on all platforms):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("reconhub/outbreaker2")
```

To add local copies of the vignettes, you will need to specify:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("reconhub/outbreaker2", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Then, to load the package, use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("outbreaker2")
```

Documentation
-------------

*outbreaker2* is fully documented on a [dedicated
 website](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaker2/).

It also comes with the following vignettes:

- **`introduction`**: general introduction using a worked example.
- **`overview`**: brief overview of the package's content.
- **`customisation`**: customisation of priors, likelihoods, and movement functions.
- **`Rcpp_API`**: documentation for the Rcpp API.
